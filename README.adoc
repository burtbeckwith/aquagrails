:experimental:

arc42 case-study for a documentation toolchain using Enterprise-Architect (c),
Powerpoint (c), AsciiDoc within an automated (documentation) build toolchain...

It's build around _Children Swimming League_ - a fictional sporting league
invented by Peter Hruschka, and widely used within his requirements and architecture
classes.

The software solution is based upon Grails - and the documentation toolchain
is crafted and maintained by Ralf D. MÃ¼ller.

The first draft of the documentation can be found in this projects wiki. (click on the book icon on the right)

== Introduction

*Grails* is a great rapid application development framework which gives the developer a kickstart by providing 
help through scaffolding. Unfortunately, this scaffolding is only available for controllers, views and 
automated tests, but not for documentation.

*arc42* on provides a great template for the documentation of software solution architectures - scaffolding for 
documentation!

In this case study, I try to bring both worlds together in the best possible way and will document all my steps, 
shortcuts and pitfalls as I go along.

Feel free to add your knowledge by joining the project!

== working with the code...

Just clone the code and you are ready to go:

type +grailsw run-app+ to start the application

type +grailsw test-app functional:+ to run the tests. GhostDriver is configured as default WebDriver, so you'll 
need http://phantomjs.org/[PhantomJS] installed. You'll find the test results in +/target/test-reports/html/all.html+ 
and screenshots in +/target/test-reports/geb/.+ . If you prefer watching the tests beeing executed, you can easily 
switch to the FireFox WebDriver by running the tests with +grails -Dgeb.env=firefox test-app functional:+ or 
+grails "-Dgeb.env=firefox" test-app functional:+ if you are working with a windows system. For other WebDrivers, 
you have to configure the dependencies section in the BuildConfig.groovy and the GebConfig.Groovy.
